Assembly Line Simulation

In this exercise you will be implementing all methods of The FactoryAssemblyLine class. The FactoryAssemblyLine class is a minimal simulation of an assembly line in a factory. The tests folder contains completed tests that will test your implementation. 

The goal of this exercise is to implement the FactoryAssemblyLine class so that all tests pass.
