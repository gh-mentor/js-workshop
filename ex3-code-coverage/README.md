Improving the UserManager Class

In this exercise, we will analyze a poorly designed TypeScript module that demonstrates bad practices such as excessive nesting, lack of error handling, poor testability, and no separation of concerns. The goal is to refactor the code to improve its structure and maintainability.

### Key Issues to Address

1. **Excessive Nesting**: The code contains deeply nested structures that make it difficult to read and maintain.
2. **Lack of Error Handling**: There are no mechanisms in place to handle potential errors, leading to unhandled exceptions.
3. **Poor Testability**: The current design makes it challenging to write unit tests due to tight coupling and lack of modularity.
4. **No Separation of Concerns**: Different responsibilities are mixed together, violating the single responsibility principle.

### Suggested Improvements

- Refactor the code to reduce nesting levels.
- Implement proper error handling mechanisms.
- Break down the module into smaller, more manageable components.
- Ensure that each component has a single responsibility.

By addressing these issues, we can improve the overall quality and maintainability of the code.
